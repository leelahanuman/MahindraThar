        <p class="paraline">The second generation Thar was unveiled on August 15, 2020.[3][4] It became available in October 2020.

          It comes with two engine options, a 2.0-litre petrol and a 2.2-litre diesel. Both are offered with a choice of 6-speed automatic transmission (with a torque converter gearbox) made by Aisin or 6-speed manual transmission. Customers have the option to choose between a hard top, soft top or soft top with convertible like folding down mechanism.[5][6]
          
          Safety
          Global NCAP crash-tested the second-generation Mahindra Thar in its basic safety specification of two airbags and ISOFIX anchorages in 2020 (similar to Latin NCAP 2013). It achieved four stars for adult protection, with its passenger compartment remaining stable in the offset frontal test. However, its footwell ruptured during the test. The car was penalised for instability of footwell response and for this reason Mahindra was denied the opportunity of demonstrating that sharp structures in the dashboard could prove benign to the knees of differently sized occupants. Hence Global NCAP penalised the knee areas and the vehicle could not achieve the maximum five star rating for adult protection.
          
          Nevertheless, Mahindra requested an ECE side impact test for the Thar, in which the car passed this basic test despite not being fitted with side airbags.[7] The driver's seat in the Mahindra Thar is high enough for the car to be exempted from this regulation, but Global NCAP required that the test be performed nevertheless. However, since the Thar lost crucial points in the frontal impact, the side impact had no influence on the result.
          
          The Mahindra Thar was sold in a basic trim level with side-facing rear seats. These seats were not fitted with three-point seatbelts or ISOFIX anchorages and would render the vehicle unsuitable for safely transporting children, which would cause Global NCAP to award the car no stars for child occupant protection. Global NCAP warned Mahindra to withdraw this variant of the Thar from the market, failing which they would publish a result of this basic variant in addition to the tested variant. Global NCAP only agreed to publish the result of a variant with forward-facing seats after sales of the basic variant were stopped,[8] making forward-facing seats the basic specification for the model.
          
          Mahindra also requested Global NCAP to test the Thar's optional electronic stability control. The model met minimum performance requirements for yaw rate in the UN's test with a steering robot, but it showed unstable dynamic behaviour with tendency to roll, and Global NCAP recommended an improvement, to deliver a more robust performance in real-life scenarios.[9]
          
          The Thar is not fitted with side impact airbags for the body or head, even as an option.</p>

          <p class="paraline">n 2020, Mahindra introduced the second generation Thar, which was a completely redesigned version of the vehicle. The Thar 2020 has a new, more modern design that features a bold grille, LED headlights, and a hardtop roof. It is powered by either a 2.0-liter turbocharged gasoline engine or a 2.2-liter turbocharged diesel engine, both of which are mated to either a six-speed manual or a six-speed automatic transmission. The Thar 2020 also has updated suspension and drivetrain components, as well as a range of new features, such as a touchscreen infotainment system, a rearview camera, and an adventure statistics display. The Thar 2020 is available in two trim levels: the AX and the LX, with the latter being the more premium option.

            The Mahindra Thar has been well-received by both off-road enthusiasts and the general public in India. It has become a popular vehicle for adventure enthusiasts, as it is capable of handling some of the most challenging terrains in India.</p>
